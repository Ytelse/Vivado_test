In exercises 1 and 2, the hand-out does not include any per-module test benches
since you are free to determine for yourself how to decompose your design into
modules. If, however, you wish to add per-module test benches in your design to
check the operation of smaller parts of your design, you are of course free to
do so. If you add the test benches in this folder, then the Makefile project
will be able to run them as in exercise 0.
